# Sales App

## Mark Joseph

## In order to add something to sell, users must register and login. All post submitted must be aproved by the admin in order to show up publicly to everyone.
## Once a post is public, logged in users can chat with the person who originally posted the item via a chat section of the app.
## Admins can delete post/users and approve or reject post submitted by users

#### Admin id needs to be set in order to see admin panel. The following files need to be changed in order to do that

                                                               imports/ui/AdminPage.
